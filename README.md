# CSS Animations for Magento Page Builder

Adding CSS animations to Page Builder. The aim is to make pages and content more engaging through the use of movement. Using CSS animations is preferred over JS animations as it's repeatable and well supported.

This also includes JS which will trigger the animation when it comes into viewport.

## Installation
